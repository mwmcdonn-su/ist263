        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
       <p>Hi, my name is Madison Wynter McDonnell and I am a senior at Syracuse University. I am studying Public Health with a concentration in Healthcare Management and minoring in Information Management and Technology. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work at <strong>Teva</strong>, which is a pharmaceutical company, where I got to work in the multi-channel marketing team. I really had a unique opportunity learning about the inner works of the corporate world and I truly found my passion for medicine. This internship made me excited for my professional career ahead of me.Outside of my academic and work life, I enjoy playing tennis, hanging out with friends, and working out. Recently, I have been into Pilates, which is a light impact workout. I have younger sister who goes to Penn State University, and I am planning on visiting her soon to witness a Penn State football game. When we both aren't at school, we like to binge watch movie series together.</p>
