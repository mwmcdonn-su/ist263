            Hi! My name is Madison McDonnell and I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. I am a Public Health major with a concentration in Healthcare Management and an Information Management Technology minor looking to pursue a career in Pharma or Healthcare Consulting. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as a Marketing- Commercial Operations intern at Teva Pharmaceuticals. I worked with multiple functional groups which focused directly with different health organizations and stakeholders. When Im not in the classroom, Im usually spending time on sorority recruitment, as I am the recruitment chair this year or freshening up on my tennis skills.

        <h2> Why Copenhagen?</h2>

            To be up front, Copenhagen was not my first option when it came to picking where I wanted to go abroad. As most of my friends were studying in Italy and Spain, I felt a sense of “what am I doing,” but little did I know I would have the most life changing experience. As you dive into this website, I want you to feel the culture, beauty, and excitement of all Copenhagen has to offer. From the food to the people to the overall experience I had, I seriously would suggest Copenhagen to anyone!
